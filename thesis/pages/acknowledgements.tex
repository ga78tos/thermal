First and foremost, I would like to thank Mr. Mingchuan Zhou for his advice and assistance he provided throughout the creation of this thesis, as well as Prof. Knoll for the chance to write it at the chair of Robotics and Embedded Systems. Additionally I wish to thank my family and friends for their constant support during my bachelor studies.
